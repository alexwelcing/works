[[Journal Notes]] #1

- [ ] 5 Rust challenges,
- [ ] Evaluate Foam Ruby vs. NextJS sites on platforms Vercel and Netlify
- [ ] Clean up
- [ ] One page of creative writing.

After 1 hour of work. None of the above has been accomplished. We have instead configured [[Twitch]] and added a myriad of additional notes inside the Foam network.
