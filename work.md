In exchange for local currency, I have done the following services.

[[2006]]: The groceries go in bags, and the bags go in the cars. The carts go in the corales. [[Somewhere, TX]]
[[2007]]: Groceries are scanned and bagged, money goes in the till. Memorize hundreds of product code and use Command Line based Point-of-Sale system.
[[2009]] + [[2010]]: Atomic simulation research, trying to discover stable MgLi! High performance computing [[HPC]] materials science lab at University of North Texas, amazing mentor, 10/1o should have just stayed and done a PhD.
[[2010]] - [[2013]]: [[Red Bull]] guerilla marketing and culture infiltration for three long years. Threw events, got press, expanded distribution into the bar and bookstore.
[[2013]]: Liquor retail and major advertising agencies. Large teams working on our campaign, big monthly spends across digital, print, and out-of-home. Amazing mentor, 10/10, should have just stayed and expanded on the home liquor delivery service.
